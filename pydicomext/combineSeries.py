                  spacingTolerance=0.1):
    """Combines a series into an N-D Numpy array and returns some information about the volume

    Many of the parameters are from the :meth:`sortSeries` function which this function will call unless the series has
    already been sorted once before.

    After combining the series into a N-D volume, the following additional parameters are calculated and inserted into
    the :class:`Volume` class:
    * Origin
    * Orientation
    * Spacing
    * Coordinate system

    The volume will be shaped such that it adheres to C-order indexing rather than Fortran-order indexing. This means
    that the slowest varying axis will be first and the fastest varying axis will be last. As an example, a
    spatiotemporal volume would be indexed like (t, z, y, x). In accordance with this convention, the spacing
    parameter will match the order of the dimensions. For example, the second element of the spacing array will
    correspond to the spacing of the z-axis.

    Two other parameters do **not** follow this convention however. The origin is Fortran-ordered, or Cartesian indexed,
    such that the origin is (x, y, z). This was decided because the origin is a spatial point and that is the typical
    way of representing a point. In a similar manner, the orientation matrix is constructed such that the left column
    is the x cosines, and the right most column is the z cosines.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : Series

        See :meth:`sortSeries` for more information on this parameter. Only used if the series has **not** been sorted
        yet.
    squeeze : bool, optional
        See :meth:`sortSeries` for more information on this parameter. Only used if the series has **not** been sorted
        yet.
    warn : bool, optional
        See :meth:`sortSeries` for more information on this parameter. Only used if the series has **not** been sorted
        yet.
    shapeTolerance : float, optional
        See :meth:`sortSeries` for more information on this parameter. Only used if the series has **not** been sorted
        yet.
    spacingTolerance : float, optional
        See :meth:`sortSeries` for more information on this parameter. Only used if the series has **not** been sorted
        yet.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the series is empty
    Exception
        If datasets do not have the same image shape
    Exception
        If datasets do not have uniform image spacing or orientation

    Returns
    -------
    Volume
        Volume that contains Numpy array, origin, spacing and other relevant information
