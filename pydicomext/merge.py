def mergeSeries(seriess, indices=None):
    """Merge a list of series into one series only taking the specified indices from the list of series

    Takes each series in the list of series' and combines them into one large series. In addition, if the :obj:`indices`
    argument is specified, then specified indices from each of the series will be selected and placed into the
    resulting merged series.

    The length of :obj:`indices` should be the same as :obj:`seriess`. Each series will select datasets using the
    corresponding indices from the :obj:`indices` argument. For example, the 7th series in :obj:`seriess` will use the
    index or list of indices at the 7th index of :obj:`indices`.

    If one series is given in the list of series', then that series will be returned regardless of whether indices are
    given to extract.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seriess : list(Series)
        List of series to combine into one merged series
    indices : list(list(int)) or list(int), optional
        list of lists of integers that represent indices to place into the merged series (default is None, which uses
        all indices from the series'). If any of the indices are None an empty list/tuple or anything besides an
        integer, then no datasets from that series will not be added to the merged series.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If there are no series in the list of series'
    TypeError
        If the length of indices is not equal to the length of the series'

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Merged series from the combination of series'
