    """Sorts datasets in series based on its metadata

    Sorting the datasets within the series can be done based on a number of parameters, which are primarily going to be
    spatial or temporal based.

    Parameters
    ----------
    series : Series
    methods : MethodType or list(MethodType), optional
        A single method or a list of methods to use when sorting the series. If this is :obj:`MethodType.Unknown`, then
        the best methods will be retrieved based on the datasets metadata. If a list of methods are given, then the
        series is sorted in order from left to right of the methods. This in effect will create multidimensional series
        (the default is MethodType.Unknown which will retrieve the best methods based on the series)
    reverse : bool, optional
        Whether or not to reverse the sort, where the default sorting order is ascending (the default is False)
    squeeze : bool, optional
        Whether to remove unnecessary dimensions of size 1 (default is False, meaning dimensions are untouched). The
        resulting methods and spacing will be updated accordingly to remove unnecessary dimensions of size 1.
    warn : bool, optional
        Whether to warn or raise an exception for non-uniform grid spacing (default is True which will display warnings
        rather than exceptions)
    shapeTolerance : float, optional
        Amount of relative tolerance to allow between the shape. Default value is 1% (0.01) which should be sufficient
        in most cases. There should not be much deviation in the shape or else the volume cannot be combined easily.

        Note: Only the first shape calculated is used but this tolerance is used to verify that the shape is similar to
        all others.
    spacingTolerance : float, optional
        Amount of relative tolerance to allow between the spacing. Default value is 10% (0.10) which should be
        sufficient in most cases. However, there are instances where the coordinates have non-uniform spacing
        in which case the tolerance should be increased if the user verifies everything is alright.

        An example of where this parameter becomes useful is for the TriggerTime method because the trigger time may
        not be the same throughout the process.

        Note: Only the first spacing calculated is used but this tolerance is used to verify that spacing is similar to
        all others.

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        If the series is empty or the method is invalid

    Returns
    -------
    Series
        Series that has been sorted
