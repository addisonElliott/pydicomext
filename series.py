            warnings rather than exceptions)
        shapeTolerance : float, optional
            Amount of relative tolerance to allow between the shape. Default value is 1% (0.01) which should be

            An example of where this parameter becomes useful is for the TriggerTime method because the trigger time may

        Many of the parameters are from the :meth:`sort` function which this function will call unless the series has
        already been sorted once before.

        After combining the series into a N-D volume, the following additional parameters are calculated and inserted
        into the :class:`Volume` class:
        * Origin
        * Orientation
        * Spacing
        * Coordinate system

        The volume will be shaped such that it adheres to C-order indexing rather than Fortran-order indexing. This
        means that the slowest varying axis will be first and the fastest varying axis will be last. As an example, a
        spatiotemporal volume would be indexed like (t, z, y, x). In accordance with this convention, the spacing
        parameter will match the order of the dimensions. For example, the second element of the spacing array will
        correspond to the spacing of the z-axis.

        Two other parameters do **not** follow this convention however. The origin is Fortran-ordered, or Cartesian
        indexed, such that the origin is (x, y, z). This was decided because the origin is a spatial point and that is
        the typical way of representing a point. In a similar manner, the orientation matrix is constructed such that
        the left column is the x cosines, and the right most column is the z cosines.
