Introduction
=================
**pydicomext** provides additional functionality to the [pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/pydicom/dev) Python package which allows reading and saving DICOM files. This module extends *pydicom* to loading entire directories of DICOM files and organizing the data in terms of patients, studies and series to allow for easy traversal and identification of scans. In addition, *pydicomext* contains functions to manipulate series, merge two series together and even combine series into a Numpy volume is provided.

**If you find this project to be useful in any way, then please let me know via a GitHub issue, email or however! This will motivate me to finish it and make it a PyPi library! Feedback is always welcome**

Installing
=================
Prerequisites
-------------
* Python 3.4+
* Dependencies:
    * pydicom

Installing pypdn
-------------------------
pydicomext is currently available on `PyPi <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pydicomext/>`_. The simplest way to
install alone is using ``pip`` at a command line::

  pip install pydicomext

which installs the latest release.  To install the latest code from the repository (usually stable, but may have
undocumented changes or bugs)::

  pip install git+https://github.com/addisonElliott/pydicomext.git


For developers, you can clone the pypdn repository and run the ``setup.py`` file. Use the following commands to get
a copy from GitHub and install all dependencies::

  git clone pip install git+https://github.com/addisonElliott/pydicomext.git
  cd pydicomext
  pip install .

or, for the last line, instead use::

  pip install -e .

to install in 'develop' or 'editable' mode, where changes can be made to the local working code and Python will use
the updated code.

Test and coverage
=================
Currently, I have a local test Python file with path-specific DICOM directories that are loaded. If I decide to upload this project to PyPi, I would want to create unit tests.

Examples
=================

Loading and displaying DICOM directory information
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    dicomDir = loadDirectory('DICOM DIRECTORY HERE')

    print(dicomDir)


Result:

Combining cMRI scans into a volume
-------------

.. code-block:: python

    dicomDir = loadDirectory('DICOM DIRECTORY HERE')

    # Retrieves the only patient from the directory, throws error if more than one patient
    patient = dicomDir.only()

    # Retrieves the only study from the patient, throws error if more than one study
    study = patient.only()

    # Retrieve a list of all series that have the description 'cine_trufi_cs_2_shot'
    # Each series is a class pydicomext.Series
    # This DICOM directory has multiple series that represent a Z-slice of the heart
    # Each series has multiple temporal frames of that slice of the heart at a certain time frame
    seriess = list(iter(filter(lambda x: x.description == 'cine_trufi_cs_2_shot', study.values())))

    # Merge the series into one, essentially takes datasets from each series and puts into one big series
    series = mergeSeries(seriess)

    # Combine the series into a Numpy volume
    volume = series.combine(methods=[MethodType.StackPosition, MethodType.TemporalPositionIndex])

    # Print data of the volume, which is of type pydicomext.Volume
    # Can access Numpy array by volume.data
    print(volume)

Roadmap & Bugs
=================
- Create unit tests from local tests
- Add *separate* function in Series class that will take a Volume class and apply it to the Series
- Add a *flatten* function in Series class that will take a Series and flatten it into one Series.
  - This is useful when combining two multi-frame Series into one. This will merge that into one series.
  - Haven't thought about it much for what it will do for a standard DICOM.
- Add a *prefaltten* function (maybe rename) that will look through a series and get all differences between them.
  - This should exclude basic fields that will change such as slice location, image number, triger time, etc. Or allow some way of deciding what fields to exclude

Pull requests are welcome (and encouraged) for any or all issues!
